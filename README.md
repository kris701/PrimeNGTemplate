# PrimeNGTemplate

This is a general template, mostly for myself, that i use for general projects.

The tech-stack is:
* Database: SQL Server 2022 using TSQL
* API:      ASP.NET Web API using .NET 9
* Frontend: Angular 19 project using PrimeNG

Each folder for Database, API and Frontend each have a small readme for more info regarding the template.

The project just consists of a database with a login and user system, an API to support it, and a frontend where you can log in and create users.
